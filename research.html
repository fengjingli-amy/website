      <p>“Childbearing and Female CPAs’ Exit from the CPA Profession: Insights from China’s One-Child Policy Relaxation”<br/>  - Committee: Bin KE (Chair), Mengqiao DU, Jean (Jieyin) ZENG<br/>
      - Presented at: Hawai’i Accounting Research Conference 2026 (Scheduled), The 8th New Institutional Accounting Conference, NUS ACC Brownbag Seminar, NUS ACC Doctoral Consortium<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: This paper examines the impact of childbearing on female certified public accountants’ (CPAs) labor force participation within the CPA profession. To address the endogeneity of fertility decisions, we exploit China’s relaxation of the one-child policy beginning in 2012 as an exogenous shock to childbearing likelihood. We classify female CPAs into three groups: those directly affected by the policy change (treatment group), those not affected (control group), and a residual group that likely includes a mix of both. We find that, following the policy change, female CPAs in the treatment group are significantly more likely to exit the profession than those in the control group. In contrast, we find no comparable increase in attrition among male CPAs in the same age ranges. We further examine several labor supply and demand factors that may moderate the treatment effect. The results indicate that the effect of the policy change is attenuated in audit firms with more supportive work environments for female CPAs, such as those with a higher proportion of female partners. However, we find no evidence that the impact of the policy change varies systematically with regional social norms regarding traditional gender roles.</p>

Evidence from China"</a><br/>- with Wen WEN, Fei QIAO, Huijie HU, Asia-Pacific Journal of Accounting and Economics, 2025<br/><br/>We investigate the impact of the China Securities Investor Service Center (CSISC), a not-for-profit minority institutional investor, on corporate tax avoidance. Employing a difference-in-differences (DID) model based on a sample of Chinese listed companies during 2014–2017, we find that CSISC shareholding reduces corporate tax avoidance. We check this finding’s robustness using alternative measures of tax avoidance, alternative sampling, placebo tests, and parallel trend analysis, and our results still hold. In addition, we find the CSISC’s negative impact on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), firms with worse internal and external corporate governance, and regions with stricter tax enforcement. Further analyses reveal that the improved information environment is a potential channel through which the CSISC inhibits corporate tax avoidance. This paper enriches the literature on the impact of minority shareholder protection mechanism and the determinants of corporate tax avoidance.</p>

We find that vertical interlock has a negative impact on corporate tax avoidance. Our result is robust to alternative measures, difference-in-differences analysis, the Heckman two-stage sample selection method, an instrumental variable approach, change analysis and controlling for potential omitted variables. The impact of vertical interlock on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in firms with more related-party transactions and greater divergence between ownership and control rights. Overall, the findings suggest that vertical interlock exerts a significant influence on corporate tax behavior, providing insights into the ownership structure of business groups.</p>
