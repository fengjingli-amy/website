      <p>“The Impact of Childbearing on Female CPA Auditors’ Labor Force Participation: Insights from China’s One-Child Policy Relaxation”<br/>  - Committee: Bin KE<br/>
      - Presented at: NUS ACC Brownbag Seminar, NUS ACC Doctoral Consortium<br/><br/>ABSTRACT: This paper examines the impact of childbearing on the labor force participation of female certified public accountant auditors (CPA auditors) by exploiting China’s relaxation of the one-child policy. We find that, in response to the policy relaxation, female CPAs of typical second-parity childbearing age exhibit a higher likelihood of exiting the profession relative to their non-reproductive-age counterparts. In contrast, no comparable increase in attrition is observed among male CPAs of the same age group. The policy’s impact is mitigated in audit branches with a higher proportion of female partners and those with heavier year-end audit workloads while more pronounced in geographic locations with stricter one-child policy enforcement. In contrast, we do not find stronger effects in locations with more traditional gender norms. These findings contribute to the literature on gender and labor market dynamics by highlighting how fertility policy influences the career trajectories of female professionals in accounting.</p>

Evidence from China"</a><br/>- with Wen WEN, Fei QIAO, Huijie HU, Asia-Pacific Journal of Accounting and Economics, 2025<br/><br/>We investigate the impact of the China Securities Investor Service Center (CSISC), a not-for-profit minority institutional investor, on corporate tax avoidance. Employing a difference-in-differences (DID) model based on a sample of Chinese listed companies during 2014–2017, we find that CSISC shareholding reduces corporate tax avoidance. We check this finding’s robustness using alternative measures of tax avoidance, alternative sampling, placebo tests, and parallel trend analysis, and our results still hold. In addition, we find the CSISC’s negative impact on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), firms with worse internal and external corporate governance, and regions with stricter tax enforcement. Further analyses reveal that the improved information environment is a potential channel through which the CSISC inhibits corporate tax avoidance. This paper enriches the literature on the impact of minority shareholder protection mechanism and the determinants of corporate tax avoidance.</p>

We find that vertical interlock has a negative impact on corporate tax avoidance. Our result is robust to alternative measures, difference-in-differences analysis, the Heckman two-stage sample selection method, an instrumental variable approach, change analysis and controlling for potential omitted variables. The impact of vertical interlock on corporate tax avoidance is more pronounced in firms with more related-party transactions and greater divergence between ownership and control rights. Overall, the findings suggest that vertical interlock exerts a significant influence on corporate tax behavior, providing insights into the ownership structure of business groups.</p>
